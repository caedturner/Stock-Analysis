# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
  
  Steve's goal is to help his client gain clear insight into the stock market sector that his client is invested in. He wants to provide his client with information about the the years 2017 and 2018 to give perspective to show if the stocks they are invested in are a viable choice based on the trends. in addition to informations about the stocks his client is invested in, Steve wants to show how the other stocks are performing in comparison to help his client make the most informed decision possible. 
  
  Code has been refactored to provide results more efficiently. 

## Results

#### "DQ" 2017
  Findings show that in 2017 "DQ" yeailded a 199.4% return, which was the best of the sector. During this time stock hoplders were less likely to trade their stocks as shown by the total daily volume of 35,796,200.

#### "DQ" 2018
  Upon analysis of all the stocks we can deduct that the stock "DQ" is the least profitable stock options in the sector for 2018 (-62.6% return). Based on total daily volume, in 2018 the stocks were traded at a much higher frequency of 107,837,900.

#### Considerations
The stock which is most profitable and yeilded positive results for both 2017 and 2018 are "ENPH (average return: 105.7%).
RUN also had 2 profitable years but there are some factors that make this less profitable than "DQ". 2017 was much more profitable for "DQ" (199.4% return), where as RUN was substantially les (5.5% return).

  - "DQ" (average return: 68.4%)
  - "RUN" (average return: 44.75%)
  
### Code Refactoring

  The code has been refactored to increase efficiancy.

- Code has been reduced from 5 Sub routines to 1 Subroutine and still functions the same yet faster.
